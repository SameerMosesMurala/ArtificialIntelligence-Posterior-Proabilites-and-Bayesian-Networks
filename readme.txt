Code Structuring:
Task 1:Posterior Probabilities:
>First the observations are taken 
>For each of these observations the posterior probabilities are calculated using the previous input.

Task 2:Bayesian Network:
>Intially all the arguments are taken.
>For each of these arguements the each of the variables are seperated for conditional probabilities.
>The probabilties for the events that are not given in the input arguments are calculated.
>Method compute probability calculates the final probabilities of the event given.
